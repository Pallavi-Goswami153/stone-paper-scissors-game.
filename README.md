I created a Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JS! Here's a breakdown of how it works:

HTML (Structure):

- I created a basic HTML structure with a container element (e.g., div) to hold the game elements.
- Inside the container, I added:
    - Three images or elements to represent Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
    - A display element to show the game results.

CSS (Styling):

- I used CSS to style the game elements, making them visually appealing.
- I might have added colors, fonts, and layout styles to create an engaging game interface.

JavaScript (Logic):
- Here's a simplified overview of the JS logic:
    1. Event Listeners: I added event listeners to the Rock, Paper, and Scissors images to detect user clicks.
    2. User Choice: When a button is clicked, the corresponding user choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) is stored in a variable.
    3. Computer Choice: I generated a random computer choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) using JavaScript's Math.random() function.
    4. Game Logic: I implemented the game's winning and losing logic based on the user's choice and the computer's choice.
    5. Result Display: I updated the display element to show the game result (e.g., "you win!", "Computer win!", or "It was draw").

Game Logic Example:

- If I choose Rock and the computer chooses Scissors, I win.
- If I choose Paper and the computer chooses Rock, I win.
- If I choose Scissors and the computer chooses Paper, I win.
- If I and the computer choose the same option, It was a draw.

By combining HTML, CSS, and JS, I created a functional and engaging Rock Paper Scissors game!
